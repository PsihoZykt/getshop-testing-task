# Testing task for GetShopTV

# Content

- Entry page with background video
  (you can pause\start it with clicks,
also video pauses when you're leaving this page,
so when you return to this page video continues
playing)
- Phone page, where you input your phone.
  (You can do it with 1-9 keys, or with tab and space\enter,
or just with clicking on numbers)

Phone number is validated by third-party API,
so if you are sure that your number is correct,
but app says that it doesn't, maybe it's because
API limit was spent.
You need to type a number and set an agreement about 
personal data to proceed

- Slider Page with three images, you can move around
with left\right arrows on your keyboard, or just by clicking
on arrows

You can return to Video page by clicking X on right-top corner of screen
